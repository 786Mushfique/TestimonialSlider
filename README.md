Testimonial Slider 

1) I made a simple and neat Testimonial Slider with React.js 

2) This slider can be used on any website to showcase your users' praise in a sleek and captivating way to provide credibility to your work.

3) This slider also has a "𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐞" button to add some excitement, when the user checks the reviews.
